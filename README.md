# Final Project Client
#### _This is where the client will be turned in for 67-328 Full Stack_

Must be turned in by commiting to Github as your main branch and email us a link when complete.

## Assignment

### Setup
- Accept the assignment by clicking on the Github classroom link that will be emailed to you.

### Client
- The requirements that you stated in your SRS must each be implemented.  If a requirement is too difficult then change or remove it.  If you decide to add additional functionality, then add a requirement.  Remember that the SRS can be changed up until you turn in the project. 
### Rules - The Client will be graded using the Rubric shown in class with these additional guidelines
1. The Client must be a single page application.
2. The Client must use jQuery.
3. For simplicity, the Client should be run using lite-server like in homework 5.  You are allowed to run the client using other web servers but I will need very good instructions on how to run the code (not recommended).
4. The Client must interface with an API that uses the 4 basic httpRequests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
5. The Client must also use CSS and have a .css file for styling.  Note that styling is not being graded, only that you know how to implement styling using CSS.
6. Please try to use JavaScript properly like has been shown in class.  i.e. Arrow Functions, Proper handling of Promises, etc.
7. As a guideline; the Client should not store any data, that is what the API is for.  Remember CRUD!
